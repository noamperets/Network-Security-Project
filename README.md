# Network Simulator

This project is a network simulator written in Python. It simulates a network of nodes and links, and uses various algorithms to analyze the network's performance under different conditions.

## Features

- Generation of random network topologies with a specified number of nodes and links.
- Calculation of network parameters such as gain, interference, and capacity.
- Simulation of data flows through the network.
- Visualization of the network graph.
- Analysis of network performance under different conditions.

## Code Structure

The project consists of several Python files, with the main one being `network_simulator.py`:  This file defines the main classes used in the simulation, including `Node`, `Link`, `Route`, and `Simulator`. It also includes functions for generating the network graph, calculating network parameters, and visualizing the network.

There are also additional Python files in the project that handle various aspects of the network simulation. However, `network_simulator.py` is the core file where the main simulation classes and functions are defined.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the `main` function in the selected file.

## Customization

You can customize the simulation by modifying the parameters in the `initialize_sim` function in `network_simulator.py`. You can also replace the default functions for calculating network parameters with your own functions.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pathlib
- pickle
